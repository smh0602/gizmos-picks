# UPLOAD BY HAND: `calibration.yml`

## Current: the Ubuntu 26 / Node 24 update `[2026-09-24]`

**This file is one of 11 uploaded together.** Follow
**`docs/upload/UPLOAD-runner-image.md`**: it has every click and the
commit message. Do it after merging the pull request "Workflows: pin
Ubuntu 24.04, move to Node 24 actions, pin Python", before 2026-10-19.

`calibration.yml` is the daily "is the board delivering what it claims?" check. What changes in it:

1. `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` → `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04`, so GitHub moving
   `ubuntu-latest` to Ubuntu 26.04 on 2026-10-19 changes nothing here.
2. `actions/checkout@v4` → `@v5`: the
   Node 24 versions (GitHub is retiring Node 20).
3. Before it runs any Python, the job now installs **Python 3.12** itself (the version it gets today) instead of using the computer's, which becomes 3.14 on Ubuntu 26.04.

**No schedule, cron line or step logic changes. No cost.**
